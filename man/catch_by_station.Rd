\title{Catch per station for each length class}
\usage{
catch_by_station(Station, le, lwcoeff = c(0.01, 3), std = c("none",
  "towlength", "areaswept"), std.towlength = 4, std.towwidth = 17)
}
\arguments{
\item{Station}{A dataframe with station information. Required columns are
id (unique station id), year, towlength and strata (the strata identifyer).}

\item{le}{A dataframe with length frequency measurements. Required columns are
id (station id), length (the length class) and n (the number of fish measured) where
the latter are the "raised" numbers.}

\item{lwcoeff}{A vector of length 2, containing parameter
a and b of the length weight relationship.}

\item{std}{Character specifying standardization. Valdi character are "none",
"towlength" or "areaswept".}

\item{std.towlength}{Standard towlength in nautical miles. Default is 4 (not
used if std = "none").}

\item{std.towwidth}{Standard width of trawl in meters. Default is 17 (only
used if std = "areaswept").}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing the follow columns ..
}
\description{
Calculates the catch per station.

Similar as \code{afli.per.stod} in the fjolst-package except returns
abundance and biomass per length class, as well as abundance less than
and biomass greater than a given length class.
